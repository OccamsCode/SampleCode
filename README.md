# Sample Code

Hi! Chances are you found yourself here because you asked to see some sample code from me

## What to expect

This project orginally started in UIKit however I believe it's more beneficial to use SwiftUI.
The original UIKit project still exists a seprate branch but chances are it will never be touched again.

 ## What to expect (2.0)
 
 In this repository, you can expect to find;
 
  - **SwiftUI** - The user interface is built using Apple's new shiny UI toy.
  - **Architecture Patterns** - Within the SwiftUI world there's much discussion about what patterns, [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) is well regarded, along with other like it, how it's use would go against one of the core reasons for this project.
 - **No 3rd Frameworks** - I want to stay away from using 3rd party frameworks. I feel it's more important to display my knowledge of the underlying frameworks instead displaying which popular ones I am aware of.
 - **Unit Testing** - I'm a big proponent of unit testing, hence it's inclusion here. With the patterns and ideas I have in place it's fairly easy to test everything apart the Views. Currently I'm attempting to sustain over 65% code coverage.
 - **Pipeline/Dev Ops** - GitHub Actions running tests on Merge Requests along with a clear process for Merge Requests
 - **Cool Features** - Another core part of this project is adding cool stuff (where appropriate, obviously)
     - TBC
 
## Things to Improve/Implement

Needless to say this project will not be perfect/complete, but here's a list of features I'm looking implement in due time;

 - [ ] Full Dark Mode support
 - [ ] Full Dynamic Font support
 - [ ] Voice Over support
 - [ ] Consistent & clear naming 
 - [ ] Localisation of static text
 - [ ] Image Caching 
 - [ ] Banishing magic strings and numbers 
 - [ ] Support for iPad, MacOS & TvOS

### Small/Final Note
This repository is a continual work in progress and will be constantly updated with with ideas and patterns I like the sound of. 
With that being said, chances are this project can (and mostly will) never be truly completed. Then again what software is ever finished?
